Skyline does alot with variables and gradients along with the @media.

The effect of sizing the window and the styling changes are interesting

The note is that variables are used mostly for colors is made in the lesson, but they also say you can use for other things.

Note use of two linear-gradients in some cases, the second one is applied behind the first as I understand it.
